Hello World! This blog was created largely as a place to ramble on about several games originally produced by Eya Interactive, later known as EyaSoft, a now long defunct Korean MMO developer, and my findings and observations while working with their code bases.

While most of my attention is focused on the titles "Legend of EDDA" and "LUNA Online" (later known as LUNA Plus), their other titles will be mentioned with some frequency as well, as most of them share large portions of their code bases, and referencing between them is often beneficial, to see how the different teams in charge of each game handled the same problems.

I started playing LUNA Online when it was still a fairly new to market game in mid 2009, and fell in love with its design and atmosphere, playing it on a nearly daily basis until its closure in 2012 due to EyaSoft going bankrupt and ceasing further development. I spent a long time trying to recapture the magic I felt playing it originally, with no luck. It was then that I first learned of the concept of private servers, and found that the source code for a later version of LUNA Plus had been leaked out and was available online.

This discovery led me to spend the next several years of free time teaching myself C, C++ and MSSQL, entirely by trying to understand the source code, getting it into a properly working state, fixing bugs, and creating more bugs in the process, and repeating the whole process over again.

Later on, I found that the sources were available for almost all of their other games, and then realized the majority shared a common root code base, so despite not having any attachment to these other games, I began working on them as well, using snippets from later games to fix issues in earlier ones, and eventually getting all of their games working on a single shared engine code base.

I hope someone out there finds something of interest in all of this like I do, or that the knowledge shared can be of help to somebody. If you have any questions about anything written here, feel free to send me an email at the address in the websites footer.

See ya around!
