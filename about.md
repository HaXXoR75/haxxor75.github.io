## Hello!
My name is Brandon, I'm a Canadian with an interest in video game programming, reverse engineering, and long dead Korean MMOs. I'm self taught, and like any human I have been known to occasionally make a mistake or two, if you notice something you think is wrong in any of my posts, or have any feedback, feel free to reach out to the email in the site footer.

This a blog was started to start recording some of the random knowledge I've acquired about [EyaSoft]({% link categories/eyasoft.md %}), programming, reverse engineering, and other random junk, in case someone else finds it as interesting as I do.
